/*
    r  -> open file for reading. doens't create a new one, so file must exist 
    w  -> open file for writing. create a new file if doenst exist, or overrites 
    a  -> opens file for append, adds data at the end 
    r+ -> opens file for read and write, file must exist 
    w+ -> open file for write and read, overites old file or creats new one 
    a+ -> opens file for append and read, creats file if doesn't exist. 

    fopen() -> opens a file 
    fclose() -> closes a file 
    fprintf() -> writs formatted data to a file 
    fscanf() -> reads formatted data from a file 
    fgets() -> reads a line from the file 
    fgetc() -> reads a single charecter from the file 
    fputs() -> writs a string to a file 
    fputc() -> write a single charecter to a file
    fseek() -> moves the file pointer to a specific location in the file
    frewind() -> moves the file pointer to the beginning of the file

    argc[] -> argument count, number of argument passed to the program
    argv[] -> argument vector, array of strings that contains the argument passed to the program 

    Q) We need file handeling because: 
    A)  Reusability- data stored can be accessed, updated and deleted anywhere and anytime 
        portability- without using any data, file can be transferred to another in the computer system 
        efficient- large amount of input may be required in some programme, file handeling allows easy 
                    access to that part of the file. 
        storage capacity- allows users to store a large amount of data without storing everythign simentaniously
